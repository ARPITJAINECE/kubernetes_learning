WHY DO WE USE NODE SELECTORS?

Because sometimes you want:
High-CPU pods to run on high-CPU nodes
GPU pods to run on GPU-enabled nodes
Logging pods to run on dedicated logging nodes
Backend pods to run on private nodes
Sensitive apps to run on specific availability zones


So nodeSelector helps you control where pods must run.

1️⃣ WHAT ARE MULTI-CONTAINER PODS?

A multi-container pod is a Kubernetes Pod that contains more than one container inside the same Pod, sharing:
Same network (same IP, same ports)
Same storage volumes
Same lifecycle
Same resources (node, CPU, memory)
They work together as a team inside one Pod.

✔ They are NOT separate applications
✔ They are tightly coupled helpers
✔ They run on the same node, same Pod sandbox






2️⃣ Why do we use multi-container pods?

Because sometimes ONE container is not enough.
We use multi-container pods when containers:
Must share files
Must communicate using localhost
Must start and stop together
Are logically inseparable






3️⃣ MOST IMPORTANT RULE

Multi-container pods are used when containers MUST live together, not separately.






Types of Multi-Container Pods:
1. Co-located Container:
2. Init Containers:
3. Side-Car Container :

3️⃣ SIDECAR CONTAINERS
(Helper containers running WITH the main app)



✔ Basic Meaning

Sidecars run alongside the main container to provide continuous support.

They are a special case of co-located containers, BUT with a purpose:
Logging
Monitoring
Proxying
Syncing
Envoy/Istio agents
File updaters

Sidecar ≠ init container
Sidecar = always runs WITH main container

✔ Use Case : 
Fluentd sidecar to collect logs
Envoy proxy to route traffic
File sync sidecar
Security agent sidecar


Most common:
App writes logs → sidecar ships logs to Elasticsearch

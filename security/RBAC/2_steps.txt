3️⃣ Core RBAC Building Blocks : 
RBAC has two fundamental objects:

🔹 1. Role : Defines permissions

🔹 2. RoleBinding : Assigns those permissions to someone

Think of it as:
Role        → What you can do
RoleBinding → Who gets it



4️⃣ What a Role Actually Contains : 
A Role is always: Namespace-scoped

Defines:
    API groups
    Resources
    Verbs

A Role does NOT apply to users by itself.



5. RoleBinding — Why It Exists
    A RoleBinding answers: “Who should get this Role?”

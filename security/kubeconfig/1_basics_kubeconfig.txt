1️⃣ What is kubeconfig?  : 
kubeconfig is a configuration file that tells kubectl how to connect to a Kubernetes cluster.

kubectl by itself knows nothing:
    where the cluster is
    how to authenticate
    which cluster to use

kubeconfig solves this.




2️⃣ Where kubeconfig lives : 
kubeconfig is a client-side file, NOT a Kubernetes object.
Default location:    ~/.kube/config

It Exists on:
    Your laptop
    CI/CD runner
    Bastion server




4️⃣ How kubeconfig is created in EKS : 
In EKS, you do not create kubeconfig manually.

You run:  aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name qa-cluster


This command:
    Fetches cluster API endpoint
    Fetches cluster CA certificate
    Configures IAM authentication
    Writes everything into ~/.kube/config

1. What Is Authorization in Kubernetes? (Definition) : 
Authorization answers this question: “Is this authenticated identity allowed to perform this action on this resource?”


In Kubernetes, every request to the kube-apiserver goes through three gates:
    1. Authentication → Who are you?
    2. Authorization  → Are you allowed?
    3. Admission     → Should this request be modified or rejected?


2. What Exactly Does Authorization Decide?

Every API request has attributes, such as:
    Who: user / group / service account
    What: resource (pod, node, secret)
    Where: namespace or cluster-wide
    Action: get, list, create, delete
    API group: core, apps, batch, etc.

Authorization checks these attributes and returns: ALLOW or DENY



3. Modes in k8s Authorization : 
    a. AlwaysAllow : Every request is allowed, default
    b. AlwaysDeny : Every request is denied


------> modern k8s defaults to RBAC <------

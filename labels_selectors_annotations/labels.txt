Labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects (Pods, Deployments, Services, etc.)
They are used to identify, group, and organize resources.





Why do we use labels?
1. To select pods for a Service
2. To select pods in a Deployment/ReplicaSet
3. To categorize resources (e.g., env=dev, app=web)
4. For scaling, monitoring, scheduling


ex : 
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx
    env: dev

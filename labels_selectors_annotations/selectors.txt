Label selectors let Kubernetes find objects using labels.





There are two types:
✔ 1) Equality selector
app = nginx
env != prod

✔ 2) Set-based selector
env in (dev, qa)
tier notin (cache)






Why do we use label selectors?
1. To decide which pods a Service or Deployment should work with.




ex : 
1. A Service selects pods with app: nginx
        selector:
            app: nginx

2. Deployment using label selector:
        selector:
            matchLabels:
                app: web

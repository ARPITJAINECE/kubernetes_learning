1. What is a Static Pod? 
    👉 A Static Pod is a Pod managed directly by the kubelet on a node, not by the Kubernetes control plane.



2. When do Static Pods come into picture?
    Static Pods are used when you want:
        A Pod to always run on a specific node
        A Pod to run even if API server is down
        Node-level / bootstrap / critical components

    👉 Most commonly used for control plane components.


3. IMPORTANT : 
        Normal Pod → created via API server
        Static Pod → created via local file on node


4. Can Static Pods run WITHOUT a master node?
    👉 YES — absolutely.

    This is the BIG power of Static Pods.

    If:
    No API server
    No etcd
    No scheduler
    No controller manager

    Still:
    kubelet + static pod YAML = running container


    🔥 That means:
    kubelet alone is enough to run your app using Static Pods


5. Why Kubernetes even has Static Pods
    Because kubelet must start the control plane itself.

    Chicken-and-egg problem:

        Who starts the API server?
        → kubelet using Static Pods


    That’s why in real clusters:
    kube-apiserver
    etcd
    controller-manager
    scheduler

    are often Static Pods.



6. How Static Pods work (very simple flow)
    kubelet starts
    ↓
    kubelet watches a directory (e.g. /etc/kubernetes/manifests)
    ↓
    YAML file appears
    ↓
    kubelet creates Pod locally
    ↓
    Container runs


    No scheduler.
    No controller.
    No API calls.



7. Where do Static Pod YAMLs live?
    On the NODE filesystem, not in etcd.

    Common paths:
    /etc/kubernetes/manifests/


    Configured in kubelet as:
    --pod-manifest-path



8. What Static Pods CANNOT do (important)
    ❌ No ReplicaSets
    ❌ No Deployments
    ❌ No Services managing them
    ❌ No scheduling
    ❌ No auto-scaling

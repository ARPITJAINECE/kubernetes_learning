-------- What is a ResourceQuota in Kubernetes?
A ResourceQuota is a namespace-level limit that controls how much total resources (CPU, memory, storage, number of objects, etc.) a whole namespace is allowed to use.

Think of it like: “This namespace cannot use more than X CPU, Y memory, and Z number of Pods.”


It prevents any team/application from consuming excessive cluster resources.







Why ResourceQuotas Exist?

They are used to:-----
Prevent resource hogging
Control total usage by teams/projects
Protect shared clusters
Enforce fair usage
Limit costs

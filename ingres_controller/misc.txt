Rewrite-target : 
rewrite-target rewrites the incoming URL path to a different path before sending the request to the backend service.


Why do we need rewrite-target?
Most backend applications (like Spring Boot, Nginx, Node.js) expect requests at /, not at /pay, /api, /stream, etc.

Ingress helps by:
Accepting requests at a custom path
Rewriting that path to /
Forwarding it to the backend

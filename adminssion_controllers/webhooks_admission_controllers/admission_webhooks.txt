1. First: why “webhooks” are needed at all : 

Built-in admission controllers:
    Are generic
    Cannot cover custom company rules
    Require API server flags to change

👉 Kubernetes introduced Admission Webhooks to allow custom logic without changing Kubernetes itself.




2. What is an Admission Webhook?
An Admission Webhook is an external HTTP service that Kubernetes calls to decide what to do with an API request before the object is stored in etcd.

Kubernetes:
    Sends the request data
    Waits for webhook’s decision
    Acts accordingly




3. Overall Request Flow : 
kubectl apply
   ↓
Authentication
   ↓
Authorization
   ↓
Mutating Admission Webhooks
   ↓
Validating Admission Webhooks
   ↓
etcd




4. Step-by-Step flow : 
    User sends request (e.g., create Pod)
    API server matches request against webhook rules
    API server sends request to webhook as JSON
    Webhook evaluates the request
    Webhook responds:
        Allow / Deny
    Optional mutation patch
    API server proceeds or rejects

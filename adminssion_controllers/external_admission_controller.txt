1. What does “External” mean here?

External Admission Controller means:
    The admission logic does NOT live inside the Kubernetes API server.

Instead:
    Kubernetes calls an external service
    That service decides allow / deny / modify
    Kubernetes follows that decision

👉 This external service is contacted via a Webhook





2. How External Admission Controllers work (one-line)
Kubernetes sends the resource request to an external HTTP(S) service, waits for its response, and then either accepts, rejects, or mutates the request.



3. Why External Admission Controllers exist

Built-in admission controllers:
    Are generic
    Are limited
    Cannot handle custom business rules

External admission controllers solve:
    Custom security rules
    Organization-specific policies
    Compliance requirements




Examples : 
1. OftK
2. Elastic's ECK admission Controller
3. K-Rail
4. Cert-Manager
5. Admission Control Webhooks

1️⃣ What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)?
HPA automatically increases or decreases the number of Pods in a Deployment based on load (metrics like CPU or memory).


Simple:
More traffic → more Pods
Less traffic → fewer Pods
It scales horizontally (more Pods), not vertically (more CPU/RAM per Pod).




2️⃣ Why HPA is used : 
Without HPA:
Too few Pods → app slow
Too many Pods → wasted money

HPA keeps:
Just the right number of Pods




3️⃣ How HPA decides to scale :
HPA uses this formula:
    desiredReplicas = currentReplicas × ( currentMetric / targetMetric )



Metrics come from Metrics Server.



Example:
    Target CPU = 50%
    Current CPU = 100%
    Current Pods = 2
    desired = 2 × (100 / 50) = 4
        👉 Scale from 2 → 4 Pods




4️⃣ What HPA watches : 
HPA looks at:
    CPU or Memory usage of Pods
    NOT nodes
    NOT containers directly
    It averages all Pods

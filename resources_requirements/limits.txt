2️⃣ What Are Resource Limits?
Limits = Maximum amount of CPU and Memory a Pod is allowed to use.


#####CPU Limit : 
If a container hits CPU limit → it is throttled (slowed down).
CPU is compressible → throttling is allowed.
Memory Limit
If a container exceeds memory limit → it is OOMKilled (Out of Memory).
Memory is non-compressible → container is terminated.

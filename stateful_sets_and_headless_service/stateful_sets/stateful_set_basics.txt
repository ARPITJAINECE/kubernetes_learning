A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes workload used to run applications that need stable identity and stable storage.

In short:
    Pods have fixed names
    Pods have fixed storage
    Pods are created and deleted in order




Examples:
    Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
    Kafka
    Zookeeper
    Redis (master/replica)
    Elasticsearch

These apps need:
    Stable hostname
    Stable storage
    Ordered startup/shutdown

A Namespace is a virtual cluster inside a Kubernetes cluster — used to logically separate and organize resources (Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.).
Think of it as a folder within your cluster, helping you manage environments, access, and resource limits independently.


⚙️ Why Namespaces Are Used:
🧱 Isolation: Separate resources between teams or environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
🔒 Access Control: Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) per namespace.
⚖️ Resource Quotas: Limit CPU/memory usage for specific teams or projects.
🧭 Organization: Keep workloads structured and avoid naming conflicts.


Default Namespaces in Kubernetes:
1. default —
Used for user-created resources when no namespace is specified. It’s the general workspace for workloads and testing.
2.kube-system —
Contains all system-level components and control plane pods such as the API server, scheduler, controller manager, and CoreDNS.
3. kube-public —
A publicly readable namespace accessible to all users, even unauthenticated ones. Commonly used to store cluster-wide information or configs.
4. kube-node-lease —
Holds lease objects that record heartbeat data from each node, helping the control plane detect node health and status efficiently.

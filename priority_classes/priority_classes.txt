1. First, the core problem Kubernetes has : 

Kubernetes runs Pods on Nodes, but:
    Nodes have limited CPU & memory
    Many Pods want to run at the same time
    Sometimes new Pods arrive when the cluster is already full

So Kubernetes must answer two questions:
    Which Pod should run first?
    If there is no space, which Pod should be removed?

👉 Priority Classes exist to answer these two questions clearly and predictably.



2. What exactly is a Priority Class? (Plain meaning)

A PriorityClass is just a label with a number that says:
    “Pods using this class are more important than Pods with a lower number.”

Higher number → higher importance
Lower number → less important

Kubernetes uses this number only when resources are not enough.



3. Where does priority matter? : 
Priority matters in only two situations:

1️⃣ Scheduling (Pod is waiting to run)
If multiple Pods are waiting:
Kubernetes schedules higher priority Pods first

2️⃣ Resource pressure (Cluster is full)
If a high-priority Pod cannot fit:
Kubernetes removes lower-priority Pods
This removal is called Preemption

((Preemption means Kubernetes forcefully removes lower-priority Pods to make space for a higher-priority Pod.))

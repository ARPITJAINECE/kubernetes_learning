1. Newer, improved version of ReplicationController.
2. Also ensures desired number of pod replicas are maintained.
3. Uses set-based label selectors (more flexible).
4. Usually managed automatically by Deployments (you rarely create RS directly).
5. Load Balancing and Scaling.

ex:
kind: ReplicaSet
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx

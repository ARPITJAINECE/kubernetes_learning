Deployment : 
    Created through the Kubernetes API server using kubectl apply
    YAML is stored in etcd
    Managed by controllers (Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pod)
    Requires API server, scheduler, and controller manager
    Pods can be scheduled on any available node
    Supports replicas, scaling, rolling updates, rollbacks
    If a Pod dies, Kubernetes recreates it on any node
    Used for real application workloads
    Can be deleted or modified using kubectl
    Does not work if control plane is down

Static Pod : 
    Created by placing a YAML file directly on a node
    YAML lives on the node filesystem
    Managed only by kubelet
    Does not require API server or scheduler
    Always runs on one specific node
    No scaling, no replicas, no rolling updates
    If a Pod dies, kubelet restarts it on the same node
    Mainly used for control-plane and system components
    Cannot be deleted using kubectl
    Works even when the master/control plane is down`

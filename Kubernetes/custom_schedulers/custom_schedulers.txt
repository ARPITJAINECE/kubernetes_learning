Why schedulers ?
-> to decide that on which node, my Pod should run.




Default Kubernetes scheduler:
    Watches for Pending Pods
    Chooses the best node
    Binds Pod → Node


DEFAULT SCHEDULER is : kube-scheduler






Why would anyone need multiple or custom schedulers?
    Default scheduler is generic.
    But real systems may need special rules.

Common real-world needs:
    Schedule Pods based on custom business logic

Separate scheduling for:
    Batch jobs
    ML workloads
    GPU workloads
    Experimental scheduling without breaking production
    Strong isolation between workloads

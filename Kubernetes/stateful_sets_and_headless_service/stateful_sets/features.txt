Key features of StatefulSet : 

1. Stable Pod Identity : 
    Pods are named like:
        db-0
        db-1
        db-2
    Names never change, even after restart.


2. Stable Storage : 
    Each pod gets its own PVC:
        db-0 → pvc-db-0
        db-1 → pvc-db-1
    Pod restart ❌ does NOT delete data.


3. Ordered Operations : 
    Pods start one by one
    Pods stop one by one
    Scaling happens in order
This is crucial for databases and clusters.

What is a Headless Service?
    A Headless Service is a Kubernetes Service that does NOT provide load balancing and does NOT have a virtual IP. 
    It only provides DNS-based Pod discovery.




Why Headless Service exists : 
    Normal Services hide Pods behind a single IP.

    But some applications:
        Need to know each Pod individually
        Need stable identity
        Must talk to specific Pods
        Break if traffic is randomly load-balanced
    👉 Headless Service exists to expose Pods instead of hiding them.




Headless Service working flow in 2 steps : 
1. Service DNS → All Pod IPs
2. Per-Pod DNS → Exact Pod

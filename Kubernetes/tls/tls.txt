1. What is TLS :
TLS (Transport Layer Security) means:
    Secure communication over the network

TLS provides:
    Encryption – nobody can read data
    Authentication – you know who you are talking to
    Integrity – data is not modified

In simple words: TLS = HTTPS = secure + trusted communication.




2. Why Kubernetes needs TLS everywhere : 
Kubernetes is distributed. Many components talk to each other.

Without TLS:
    Anyone could impersonate API server
    Anyone could read secrets
    Anyone could modify cluster state

So Kubernetes forces TLS almost everywhere.




3. Who issues certificates in Kubernetes? : 
A : kubeadm / self-managed cluster : 
    Kubernetes creates: Its own CA

    Signs:
    API server cert
    kubelet certs
    etcd certs
    ⚠️ These DO expire (usually 1 year).

    Renewal Command : kubeadm certs renew all

    👉 Admin responsibility.

B : Managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS)
    Cloud provider manages:
        Control plane certs
        etcd certs
        kube-apiserver certs

    ✅ Auto-renewed
    ✅ Zero admin effort

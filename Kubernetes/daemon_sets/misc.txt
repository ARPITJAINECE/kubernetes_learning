1. DaemonSet Scheduling Rules

    By default:
    DaemonSet runs on all worker nodes
    Master/control-plane nodes are usually excluded

    Why?
    Masters have taints like:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule


2. Running DaemonSet on Master Nodes (Optional)

    If you want DaemonSet Pods on master nodes, you must add tolerations.

    Example:

    tolerations:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
    operator: Exists
    effect: NoSchedule

A DaemonSet ensures that exactly one Pod runs on each node (or on selected nodes) in a Kubernetes cluster.


If a new node is added → a Pod is automatically created on that node.
If a node is removed → the Pod on that node is removed.




Why DaemonSets Exist (The Problem They Solve) : 
Some workloads are node-level, not application-level.

Examples:
Collect logs from each node
Monitor each node
Configure networking on each node
Run security agents on each node


Using a Deployment for this would be wrong because:
Deployment doesn’t guarantee 1 Pod per node
Scaling replicas ≠ scaling with nodes

👉 DaemonSet scales with nodes, not with replicas

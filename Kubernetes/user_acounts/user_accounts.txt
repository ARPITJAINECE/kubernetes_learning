1️⃣ What Is a “User Account” in Kubernetes?
Users = Human users (real people) accessing the cluster.



Users login using:
kubeconfig
tokens from IAM
certificates

Key points:
These represent developers, DevOps engineers, admins.
Kubernetes does NOT store user accounts internally.







👉 Users are external to Kubernetes. They are NOT created using YAML.

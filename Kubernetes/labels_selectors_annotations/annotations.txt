What are annotations?
1. Annotations are also key-value pairs but used for storing extra information (metadata) that is NOT used for selecting or grouping resources.


Why do we use them?
1. Debug info
2. Version info
3. Contact info
4. URL links
5. Tool metadata (Ingress controllers, service mesh, monitoring tools)




YAML Example:
metadata:
  annotations:
    owner: "SRE Team"
    description: "Nginx web server"

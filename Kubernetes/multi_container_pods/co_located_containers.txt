1️⃣ CO-LOCATED CONTAINERS
(Main + helper containers running TOGETHER)


✔ Basic Meaning

These are multiple containers inside one Pod that:
Run together
Share network (same IP, ports)
Share volumes
Start at the same time
Stop at the same time

They are NOT pre-start (init)
They are NOT helper log agents (sidecar)

They are simply two containers that must live together.




✔ Use Case (Simple Example)

Application container + file-writer container
Container A produces data
Container B reads/processes the same data
Both must run together

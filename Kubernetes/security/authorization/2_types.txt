1. Node Authorization : 
    “What is a kubelet (node) allowed to do?”

        Nodes are not trusted admins.

    Each node:
        Has its own identity

    Should only access:
        Its own pods
        Its own secrets
        Its own volumes



2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) : 
(⚠️ Important: ABAC is deprecated and rarely used today — but you must understand it conceptually.)

    What Is ABAC?
        ABAC authorizes requests based on: Attributes of the request

        Example attributes:
            User name
            Group
            Resource
            Namespace
            Verb



3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) : 
    RBAC answers:
        “What role does this identity have?”

    Instead of attributes:
        You define roles
        Bind users to roles

    RBAC is:
        Declarative
        Scalable
        Auditable
        Default today



4. Webhook Authorization (External) : 
    What Is Webhook Authorization?
        Webhook authorization means: Kubernetes asks an external service: “Should I allow this request?”

    This is used when:
        You already have enterprise IAM
        You want custom logic
        You integrate with external policy engines

1. Main components of kubeconfig : 
        kubeconfig has 3 main sections:
            | Component | Meaning                              |
            | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
            | cluster   | WHERE the Kubernetes API server is   |
            | user      | HOW to authenticate                  |
            | context   | WHICH cluster + user combo is active |


A : Cluster :
        API server connection details

        It includes:
            API server URL
            CA certificate

        📌 Example:
        “The Kubernetes API is available at this HTTPS endpoint.”


B : User : 
        authentication method

        NOT:
            Kubernetes user
            IAM user
            Human user

        It simply defines:
            certificate
            token
            or IAM-based auth (EKS)

        📌 In EKS, user usually means: “Use AWS IAM to authenticate.”

C : Context :
        a shortcut that combines cluster + user

        This allows:
            Easy switching between clusters
            One active cluster at a time

        Example: kubectl config use-context qa-cluster

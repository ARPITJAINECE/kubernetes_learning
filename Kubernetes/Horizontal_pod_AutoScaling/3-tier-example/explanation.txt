Scenario : 
An e-commerce application runs on Kubernetes with three tiers: frontend, backend, and database. 
Users access the website through the frontend, which sends requests to backend services. 
The backend processes business logic and queries a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS.




Explanation :
User traffic first reaches the frontend pods through a load balancer. 
The frontend calls backend APIs for actions like login, browsing products, and placing orders. 
Backend pods execute logic and fetch or store data in the database. 
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler monitors CPU and memory usage of frontend and backend pods. When traffic increases, HPA adds more pods to handle load. 
When traffic drops, it reduces pods, saving resources, while the database remains stable.

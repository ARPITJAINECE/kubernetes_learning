1.  lets say if we dont have defined globaldefault and also no priorityclassname is there in pod definition file.
    then, by defualt k8s gives that (one or many) pod (or s), priority=0





2. PriorityClass defines how important a Pod is. Pods with higher priority are scheduled first and can preempt (kill) lower-priority Pods when resources are insufficient. 
   globalDefault defines the priority for Pods that do not explicitly specify one.

What is preemptionPolicy?

You will see this inside PriorityClass, so understand it here itself.

Meaning:
If a Pod using this PriorityClass cannot be scheduled due to lack of resources, Kubernetes is allowed to remove lower-priority Pods.

1. PreemptLowerPriority----Allow killing lower-priority Pods
2. Never----Do NOT kill any Pods, even if priority is high

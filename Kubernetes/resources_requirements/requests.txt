1️⃣ What Are Resource Requests?
Requests = Minimum amount of CPU and Memory a Pod needs to run.



---> Kubernetes uses requests to decide:
1. Where to schedule the Pod
2. Whether a node has enough resources


ex::::::::

If a Pod requests:
requests:
  cpu: "200m"
  memory: "256Mi"



-------> Kubernetes guarantees:
It will only place the Pod on a node that has at least 200 millicores CPU + 256Mi Memory free.



Requests = guaranteed minimum.

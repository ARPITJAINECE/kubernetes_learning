secrets needs to be base64 encoded before injecting those into secret yaml file, using below command : 
echo -n "abc" | base64     -> it will give that base64 output of abc




1. What is a Secret in Kubernetes?
A Secret stores sensitive data (passwords, tokens, certificates, keys) in Kubernetes so you don’t hardcode sensitive values in Pod YAMLs, ConfigMaps, or container images.

Think of it like:
A private, secure storage inside Kubernetes for credentials.


2. Why Secrets Are Needed
Secrets help you:
Avoid putting passwords inside images
Avoid committing credentials into Git
Inject sensitive values into Pods securely
Rotate secrets without rebuilding apps
Protect access to DBs, APIs, TLS certificates, SSH keys, OAuth tokens, etc.



3. Are Secrets Encrypted?
By default: They are Base64-encoded, NOT encrypted

But you can enable encryption at rest (AES-256) at cluster level
They are sent to nodes over TLS
They are only mounted on the nodes where Pods need them.





4. Types of Secrets :

a. Opaque (default)
Stores generic key-value secrets
Most commonly used

b. docker-registry
Stores credentials for private container registry login

c. tls
Stores TLS cert and private key
Used for HTTPS in Ingress

d. service-account-token
Auto-generated for service accounts

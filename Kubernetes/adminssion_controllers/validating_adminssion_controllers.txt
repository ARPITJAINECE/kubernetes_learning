1. What is a Validating Admission Controller?
    It is a Kubernetes component that DECIDES whether a request is allowed or rejected before the object is stored in etcd.


It:
    Runs after authentication
    Runs after authorization
    Runs after mutating admission controllers
    Runs just before persistence




((((((  It enforces rules. It does not fix things.  ))))))




2. Why validating admission controllers exist

RBAC answers:
    “Who can do what?”

But validating admission controllers answer:
    “Is this request acceptable according to our rules?”

They enforce:
    Security rules
    Organizational policies
    Best-practice compliance




3. What kind of policies do validating admission controllers enforce?
    Validating admission controllers enforce RESTRICTION and COMPLIANCE policies.

Common policy categories:
    Security policies
    Configuration policies
    Governance policies
    Operational safety policies
    Label and Annotation Policies
    Naming Conventions
    Custom Checks
    Regulatory Compliances



Examples of Validating Admission Controller policies : 
1. PodSecurityPolicy (PSP)
2. Resource Quota
3. NetworkPolicies
4. Namespace Admission Policies




A Validating Admission Controller enforces policies by allowing or rejecting Kubernetes API requests.
It is done based on defined rules, without modifying the resource, after mutation but before persistence.

What does “Custom Admission Controller” mean?
It is a user-defined policy component that Kubernetes calls before creating or updating resources, so you can enforce your own rules.

In practice, this means:
    You write your own logic
    Kubernetes calls it automatically
    It decides to allow, deny, or modify requests

👉 Custom admission controllers are implemented using Admission Webhooks.

1. What is a Mutating Admission Controller?
A Mutating Admission Controller is a Kubernetes component that MODIFIES an API request before the object is stored in etcd.
It changes the object to enforce defaults, policies, or automation.


It runs:
    After authentication
    After authorization
    Before validating admission controllers



Why does Kubernetes need mutating admission controllers?
    Users often forget best practices
    Repeating the same configuration is error-prone
    Some behavior must be automatic and consistent

Mutating controllers help by:
    Reducing human error
    Enforcing standards automatically
    Injecting required configuration





Built-in deafult mutating policies : 
1. DefaultStorageClass
2. LimitRanger
3. ServiceAccount
4. NamespaceLifecycle
5. TaintNodesByCondition
6. AlwaysPullImages









Mutating controllers run BEFORE validating controllers

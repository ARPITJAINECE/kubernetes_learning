storageClassName is the link between your PVC and a StorageClass.


example : 

1. StorageClass
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast-storage

2. PVC
spec:
  storageClassName: fast-storage


What happens internally : 
    Step-by-step:
        PVC is created
        Kubernetes sees storageClassName: fast-storage
        Finds StorageClass named fast-storage
        Uses its provisioner
        Creates a PV dynamically
        Binds PVC to PV

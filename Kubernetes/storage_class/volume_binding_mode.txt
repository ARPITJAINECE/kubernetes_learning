This controls when the PV is created and bound.

Types of volume binding modes : 

1. Immediate (default) : 
    PV is created immediately
    Before Pod is scheduled

    Problem:
        Storage may be created in wrong zone
        Pod may not fit on node


2. WaitForFirstConsumer (recommended) : 
    PV is created only after Pod is scheduled
    Storage is created in correct zone

    This avoids:
        Cross-zone issues
        Scheduling failures

    👉 Always use this in cloud environments

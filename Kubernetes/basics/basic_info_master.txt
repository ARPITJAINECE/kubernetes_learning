1️⃣ API Server
Central communication hub of Kubernetes.
Receives all requests, validates them, and updates cluster data in etcd.
Acts as the main entry point for everything.


2️⃣ etcd
A reliable key-value database storing entire cluster state — pods, nodes, configs, secrets.
It’s the cluster’s memory, ensuring data consistency and recovery after restarts.


3️⃣ Controller Manager
Runs background controllers that maintain desired state of the cluster.
Automatically creates, updates, or deletes pods and resources to keep things running correctly.


4️⃣ Scheduler
Decides which node each new pod should run on.
Chooses best node based on available resources, policies, and constraints for optimal workload distribution.

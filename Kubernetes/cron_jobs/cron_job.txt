What is a CronJob in Kubernetes?

A CronJob is a Kubernetes object that runs Jobs on a schedule, similar to Linux cron.

✔ It automatically creates Jobs at specific times
✔ Jobs create Pods that run → finish → exit
✔ Used for repeated tasks (daily, hourly, weekly)







Why do we use CronJobs?

Because some tasks must run:
every minute
every hour
every night
every Monday
every month

CronJob automates repeated background work.




Common Use Cases:
Daily database backup
Log cleanup
Sending scheduled reports
Data processing scripts
Regular sync jobs

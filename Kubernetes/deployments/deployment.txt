A Deployment is a higher-level controller in Kubernetes.
It manages ReplicaSets and Pods to ensure your application runs reliably and predictably.
It defines the desired state (like number of replicas, container image version, etc.).
Kubernetes automatically makes the actual state match it.




⚙️ Key Use Cases
Rolling Updates → Update app versions without downtime.
Rollbacks → Easily revert to previous versions if something breaks.
Scaling → Increase/decrease replicas dynamically for load management.
Self-Healing → Automatically replaces failed pods.
Declarative Management → You describe what you want; Kubernetes handles how to get there.



A Deployment automates pod updates, scaling, and recovery — ensuring smooth, zero-downtime app delivery and easy version control in Kubernetes.

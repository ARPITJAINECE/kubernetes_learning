A Service in Kubernetes is a stable networking abstraction that exposes a group of Pods under a single, consistent IP address and DNS name, even if Pods change over time.


⚙️ Key Points (Crisp Basics)
Pods are ephemeral — they get recreated, changing IPs.
A Service provides a permanent endpoint to access those Pods.
It routes traffic to Pods using label selectors.
Ensures load balancing across healthy Pods.
Can expose Pods internally or externally based on type.
Decouples applications from dynamic Pod IPs.
Supports discovery, scaling, and stable connectivity within the cluster.



🔹 Types of Services in Kubernetes:

1️⃣ ClusterIP (Default):
Exposes the service internally within the cluster only.
Used for communication between services (e.g., frontend → backend).
Accessible via an internal cluster IP.
🧠 Example: Internal database service.

2️⃣ NodePort:
Exposes the service on a static port (30000–32767) on each node’s IP.
External clients can reach the service using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
🧠 Example: Accessing an app from outside the cluster for testing.

<<<<<<<<<<<       ports in node port type          >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1️⃣ Port (Service level):
Exposes the Service inside the cluster so other Pods can access it.

2️⃣ TargetPort (Pod level):
The actual port on the container where the application listens.

3️⃣ NodePort (Node level):
The external port on each node that forwards traffic to the Service.

3️⃣ LoadBalancer:
Creates an external load balancer (via cloud provider) to expose the service publicly.
Distributes external traffic across Pods.
🧠 Example: Public-facing web apps (e.g., production frontend).

4️⃣ ExternalName:
Maps a Service to an external DNS name (no selector, no cluster IP).
Useful to access external services using internal DNS.
🧠 Example: mysql.external.com mapped to internal mysql-service.

5️⃣ (Bonus) Headless Service
Created by setting clusterIP: None.
Returns Pod IPs directly for fine-grained control (used in StatefulSets).
🧠 Example: Databases like Cassandra or Kafka.

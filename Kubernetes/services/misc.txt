service 

node port allow a port to be exposed to outside the world and also that port is of my node.


1️⃣ ClusterIP (Internal Service)

Default and most commonly used Service type.
Exposes the app only inside the cluster.
Ideal for backend microservices and databases.
Provides internal load-balancing and DNS-based service discovery.
Essential for large microservice architectures (50+ services).




2️⃣ NodePort (Basic External Access)

Exposes the Service on every node’s IP at ports 30000–32767.
Allows simple external access without cloud load balancers.
Not recommended for real production due to limitations.
Useful for dev, testing, demos, or bare-metal clusters.
Lacks advanced routing, TLS termination, and HA features.



3️⃣ LoadBalancer (Production External Access)

Creates a cloud load balancer (AWS ELB, GCP LB, Azure LB).
Best for production-grade external access for frontends or public APIs.
Handles external traffic reliably and distributes it to Pods.
Supports HTTPS/TLS, health checks, HA, and scalability.
Works perfectly with large microservice backends (ClusterIP-only).

Why do we need Network Policies?
Because by default all pods can talk to all pods (open network).

NetworkPolicy lets you create a firewall at pod level:
Allow specific ingress
Allow specific egress
Block everything else





Example : 

Pods:
    frontend-pod
    backend-pod
    db-pod

Requirement:
    Frontend → ❌ cannot talk to DB
    Backend → ✅ allowed to talk to DB on port 5432
    DB → should only accept traffic from backend

    We achieve this using a NetworkPolicy on the database pod.







Network Policies = firewall rules for pods 
They work ONLY if a CNI plugin supports them (Calico, Cilium, WeaveNet).

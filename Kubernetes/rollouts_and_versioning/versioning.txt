Definition : Versioning means Kubernetes keeps a history of previous deployment revisions using ReplicaSets.



Every time you update a Deployment (such as changing image), Kubernetes:
1. Creates a new ReplicaSet → new version
2. Keeps old ReplicaSets → older version
3. Allows you to rollback any time



Example:
ReplicaSet-1 → nginx:1.18   (revision 1)
ReplicaSet-2 → nginx:1.19   (revision 2)
ReplicaSet-3 → nginx:1.20   (revision 3)

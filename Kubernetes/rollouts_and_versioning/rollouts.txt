Definition : A rollout is the process of updating Pods in a Deployment to a new version in a controlled way.


What rollout does:
1. Replaces old pods with new pods
2. Ensures stability
3. Prevents downtime (depending on strategy)
4. Creates a new ReplicaSet for the new version
5. Keeps old ReplicaSets for rollback



----Types of Rollout Strategies in Kubernetes

 1. Rolling Update (DEFAULT, MOST USED)
Pods updated gradually → no downtime.

 2. Recreate
Stops ALL old pods → then starts ALL new ones → downtime happens.

 3. Blue-Green Deployment (not built-in, done using labels/Service switch)
Run two full environments → switch traffic instantly.

 4. Canary Deployment (not built-in, done using multiple Deployments + routing)
Release new version to small % of users → then increase gradually.

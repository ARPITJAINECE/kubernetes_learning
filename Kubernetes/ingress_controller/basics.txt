1. What is Ingress?
Ingress is a Kubernetes object that defines rules for how external HTTP/HTTPS traffic enters your cluster and reaches your Services.

👉 Ingress itself does NOT handle traffic.
👉 It only describes rules.

Think of it like:

Ingress = traffic rulebook





2️⃣ Why Ingress Exists : ->
Problem before Ingress : 
If you expose apps using Services:
App 1 → Service (LoadBalancer)
App 2 → Service (LoadBalancer)
App 3 → Service (LoadBalancer)

❌ You get:
Multiple external IPs
Higher cloud cost
No URL-based routing
No centralized TLS


3️⃣ Ingress exists to:

Use one external IP
Route traffic using URL & domain
Centralize TLS/HTTPS
Act as a smart entry point





4️⃣ Service vs Ingress
A. Service
Routes traffic inside the cluster
Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
Knows nothing about URLs

Service → "Send traffic to these Pods"


B. Ingress
Routes traffic from outside
Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)

Understands:
Domains
Paths
Headers

Ingress → "If URL looks like this, go to that Service"

What Is a Job in Kubernetes?

A Job is a Kubernetes object used to run a one-time task that must complete successfully.

✔ Runs a task once
✔ Retries if the task fails
✔ Stops after success
✔ Ensures task completion

Jobs are designed for work that must finish, not run forever.





Deployment = run forever
Job = run once and finish

✔ Backup scripts
✔ Sending reports
✔ Cleaning logs
✔ Database initialization

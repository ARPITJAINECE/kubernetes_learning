1️⃣ WHAT IS NODE AFFINITY?
Node Affinity is an advanced version of nodeSelector.

nodeSelector = EXACT MATCH (only equals)

---> NodeAffinity = RICH RULES like:
Must run on nodes with these labels
Prefer to run on nodes with these labels
Match multiple values
Match using logic (In, NotIn, Exists)

👉 Node Affinity = Smarter, flexible placement rules for pods.








2️⃣ WHY is Node Affinity needed?

nodeSelector has big limitations:
No OR conditions
No NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist
No preferences — only strict requirements





3️⃣ TWO TYPES OF NODE AFFINITY : 

✔ 1) requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
This is strict.
“Pod MUST run on nodes matching these rules or it will NOT be scheduled.”
Equivalent to hard requirement.

✔ 2) preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
This is soft.
“Prefer these nodes, but if not available, run anywhere.”
Equivalent to soft preference.

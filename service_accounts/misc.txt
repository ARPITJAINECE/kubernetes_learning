Why Service Accounts Exist? (Most Important Reasons)


✔ 1. For Pods to authenticate to Kubernetes API
Example: a Pod wants to read ConfigMaps or list Pods.

✔ 2. To assign limited permissions using RBAC
You attach roles and rolebindings to service accounts.

✔ 3. To separate access per application
App A uses sa-app-a
App B uses sa-app-b
Different permissions → better security

✔ 4. For cloud integrations
Used by:
ExternalDNS
ArgoCD
Prometheus
Ingress controllers
Storage drivers
These Pods MUST use service accounts.

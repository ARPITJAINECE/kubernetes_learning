STEP 1 — Apply a taint on a node : 

Assume your node name is:
worker-node1

Apply taint:
kubectl taint nodes worker-node1 app=demo:NoSchedule

Meaning:
“Do NOT schedule any Pod on this node unless the Pod tolerates taint app=demo.”





EXAMPLE 1 — Pod WITHOUT toleration (will NOT run on tainted node)

pod-no-toleration.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: no-toleration-pod
spec:
  nodeName: worker-node1      # Force Pod to try scheduling on tainted node
  containers:
    - name: demo
      image: nginx

🚫 RESULT : 
This Pod will fail to schedule because:
Node has taint: app=demo:NoSchedule
Pod has no toleration
Pod is forced to worker-node1

Check status:
kubectl describe pod no-toleration-pod







EXAMPLE 2 — Pod WITH toleration (will run successfully) : 

pod-with-toleration.yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: toleration-pod
spec:
  nodeName: worker-node1
  tolerations:
    - key: "app"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "demo"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
    - name: demo
      image: nginx


✅ RESULT : 
This Pod WILL schedule on worker-node1 because:
It tolerates the taint: app=demo
Taint effect is NoSchedule

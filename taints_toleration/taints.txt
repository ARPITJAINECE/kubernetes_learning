Q): What are Taints -
Taint is something you put on a node to say:
“Don’t schedule Pods here unless they are allowed.”
It repels Pods from that node.





Q): Types of Taint Effects ? 

1️⃣ NoSchedule : 
Pods without matching tolerations will NOT be scheduled on the node.
✔ Existing pods stay
❌ New pods won't land on this node
Use case: reserve node for specific workloads
Example: GPU node, logging node, production-only node

2️⃣ PreferNoSchedule
Kubernetes tries not to schedule pods on this node,
but will if needed.
✔ Soft rule
✔ Best effort
✔ Used when cluster is low on nodes
Use case:
Suggest scheduler to avoid a node, but not enforce it strictly.

3️⃣ NoExecute
Pods without the toleration are evicted from the node  AND   new ones won’t be scheduled.
❌ New pods blocked
❌ Existing pods removed (after 0 or grace period)
Use case:
Node unhealthy, node draining, selective eviction.

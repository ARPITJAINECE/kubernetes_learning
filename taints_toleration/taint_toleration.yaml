# 1️⃣ Apply a Taint on a Node :

# Format:
# kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>=<value>:<effect>

# Example (add NoSchedule taint):
# kubectl taint nodes worker-node1 env=prod:NoSchedule

# This means:
# 👉 Only Pods with matching toleration can schedule on worker-node1.




# 2️⃣ Pod YAML WITH Toleration (so it can run on tainted node)
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: tolerant-pod
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: "env"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "prod"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx
# This pod can run on worker-node1 because it tolerates the taint.




# 3️⃣ Remove a Taint From a Node (CLI)

# Format:
# kubectl taint nodes <node-name> <key>:<effect>-

# Example (remove the taint we added):
# kubectl taint nodes worker-node1 env:NoSchedule-

# Note:
# The trailing dash (-) removes the taint.
# You do NOT include the value during removal.
